First, you create a simple HTML form with text boxes where users can enter data. The form element in HTML allows you to specify how the data will be sent (GET or POST).

</head>
<body>
    <h1>Enter Your Details</h1>
    <form action="process.php" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required><br><br>

        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="text" id="email" name="email" required><br><br>

        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
In the above example:

A form is created with two text boxes (one for the name and one for the email).

The action attribute of the form specifies the PHP file (process.php) that will process the form data.

The method="POST" means the form data will be sent as a POST request, which is more secure than GET for sending form data, especially sensitive information like email addresses.
